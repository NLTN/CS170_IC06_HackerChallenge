Extend your date validation, so that it checks for valid leap years (in which the month February has 29, instead of 28, days).  A leap year is any year that is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.  Do not allow February to have 29 days on years that are not leap years.

Also, extend your date validation so that dates such as 12/01/20155 (with extra digits at the end of the date) are considered invalid.
